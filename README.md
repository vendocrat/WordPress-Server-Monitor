##Description


Our Server Monitor plugin adds thre simple widgets to your WordPress Dashboard displaying general info about your server, PHP, your database and your WordPress installation.

We've kept the plugin as simple as possible and therefore made no settings available. But, as not all of you may need all of the information made available via this handy plugin, we've splitted it into three widgets. And as you know, you can simply hide them from the Options tab in your WordPress dashboard! Just click "Options" on the top right corner of your browser window and untick the widgets you don't need.

Oh, and for the speed junkies (like us), all data will be stored and served via a transient. This way the plugin will have no impact on your dashboard loading time!
